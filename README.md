# Restraint-in-DC
Most states don’t require private schools to report any information about restraint and seclusion – even if they get millions of dollars each year from the public school district. In a first-of-its-kind effort, the Teacher Project and the USA TODAY Network reached out to all 50 states for data on restraint and seclusion in special-education private schools. Just 10 states and Washington, D.C., were able to provide complete information. 

The Office of the State Superintendent of Education in D.C. keeps track of students from Washington, D.C. public schools who are placed into private special education schools. It lists the number of restraint/seclusion incidents that these students experience [on this webpage.](https://osse.dc.gov/page/nonpublic-school-profiles)

However, this data is not compiled all in one place, but put into a separate PDF for each individual school. I wrote this code to compile all the data into one spreadsheet so that I could calculate the total amount of times that D.C. students with disabilities who were placed into private schools were restrained and secluded.

The total: 4,458 incidents in 2015-16. See [this file](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6922485/DC-Outplacement-Restraint-and-Seclusion.pdf) for the complete list on one page.
